# Commit Graph Art - Nyan Cat

To add a Nyan Cat to your commit graph:
- Create an empty public repository and clone it locally.
- Run `python commit_graph_art.py` and follow the instructions. The python script will:
  - generate a shell script which will push commits to the given repository, following the 'NYAN_CAT' matrix for the
commit pattern.
- `cd` into the newly created repository and run the generated shell script.

To clear the Nyan Cat art from your commit graph, just delete the repository used.
